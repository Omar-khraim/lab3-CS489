Problem:
  Many individuals struggle with managing their personal finances effectively, leading to financial stress and uncertainty about where their money is going.
  Without a clear understanding of their spending habits, it's challenging for people to make informed decisions about budgeting, saving, and achieving their financial goals.
  Traditional methods of expense tracking, such as manual record-keeping or using generic spreadsheet templates, are often time-consuming, error-prone, and lack the functionality needed for comprehensive financial management.

Solution:
  To address this issue, we propose the development of an Expense Tracking Module as part of our Finance Management System. This module will provide users with a convenient and intuitive way to record, categorize, and track their expenses in real-time. By leveraging modern technologies and user-friendly interfaces, our solution aims to simplify the expense tracking process, empowering users to gain better insights into their spending habits and make more informed financial decisions.

Features:
  Expense Entry: Users can easily record details of their expenses, including the amount spent, date of the expense, and the category it belongs to.
  Categorization: Expenses can be categorized into predefined or customizable categories (e.g., groceries, utilities, transportation) for better organization and analysis.
  Budget Setting: Users can set budget limits for different expense categories, helping them manage their spending and stay within their financial goals.
